<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mercury Control Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Activated Carbons</li><li>Sorbents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mercury control market consists of two types: activated carbons and sorbents. Activated carbons are highly porous materials that have the ability to adsorb mercury from flue gas emitted by industrial sources, such as coal-fired power plants. Sorbents, on the other hand, are substances that can selectively capture and remove mercury from gas streams. Both activated carbons and sorbents play a crucial role in reducing mercury emissions and ensuring environmental compliance. These technologies are widely used in the industry to mitigate the adverse effects of mercury contamination.</p></p>
