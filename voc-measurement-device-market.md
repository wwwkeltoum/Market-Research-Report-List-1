<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VOC Measurement Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The VOC Measurement Device Market is divided into two types: PID (Photoionization Detector) and Metal-oxide Semiconductor. PID devices measure volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air by ionizing the molecules using ultraviolet light and detecting the resulting electrical current. These devices are highly sensitive and can measure a wide range of VOCs. Metal-oxide Semiconductor devices, on the other hand, detect VOCs by their effect on a heated metal oxide surface, which causes a change in electrical resistance. These devices are cost-effective and commonly used for general VOC monitoring.</p></p>
