<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steam Generators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Steam Generators</li><li>Horizontal Steam Generators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steam generators are used to convert water into steam for various industrial applications. Vertical steam generators have a vertically oriented design, where water flows downwards through the tubes and is converted into steam at the top. This design allows for efficient heat transfer and compact installations. Horizontal steam generators, on the other hand, have a horizontally oriented design, where water flows horizontally through the tubes. They are suitable for larger installations and offer easy accessibility for maintenance. Both types cater to different industrial needs but serve the common purpose of converting water into steam.</p></p>
