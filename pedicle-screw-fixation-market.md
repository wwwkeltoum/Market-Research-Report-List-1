<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pedicle Screw Fixation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyaxial</li><li>Monoaxial</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pedicle screw fixation is a surgical technique used to treat spinal disorders and stabilizes the spine by inserting screws into the pedicles of vertebrae. There are two common types of pedicle screw fixation markets: polyaxial and monoaxial. Polyaxial screws allow for multi-directional movement, providing flexibility during surgery. On the other hand, monoaxial screws allow movement in only one direction, offering enhanced stability. Both types are used based on the specific requirements of the patient's condition, providing surgeons with options to achieve optimal outcomes in spinal surgeries.</p></p>
