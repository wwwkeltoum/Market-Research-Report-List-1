<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Voltage Transformer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Electronic Voltage Transformer</li><li>Passive Electronic Voltage Transformer</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Electronic Voltage Transformer (EVT) market can be categorized into two types: Active Electronic Voltage Transformer (AEVT) and Passive Electronic Voltage Transformer (PEVT). AEVTs are devices that employ electronic components to amplify the input voltage and provide an accurate, reliable output voltage. They are suitable for high precision applications and have advanced features such as voltage regulation. On the other hand, PEVTs do not require active electronic components and instead rely on passive components to transform the input voltage to a suitable output level. PEVTs are simpler and less expensive but may offer lower accuracy and performance compared to AEVTs.</p></p>
