<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Freediving Respiratory Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open(Open-Circuit)the Respiratory System</li><li>Enclosed(Closed-Circuit) the Respiratory System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Freediving Respiratory Systems market consists of two main types: Open (Open-Circuit) and Enclosed (Closed-Circuit) systems. Open-Circuit systems involve the diver inhaling oxygen from the surrounding environment and exhaling it back into the water. These systems are simpler and less expensive, but they can limit the dive duration due to oxygen supply constraints. On the other hand, Closed-Circuit systems recirculate the exhaled air, removing carbon dioxide and replenishing it with fresh oxygen. This allows for longer dives by conserving oxygen, but they are more complex and costlier than open systems.</p></p>
