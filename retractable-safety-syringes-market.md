<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retractable Safety Syringes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Retractable Safety Syringe</li><li>Auto-retarctable Safety Syringe</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Retractable safety syringes include two types: manual retractable safety syringes and auto-retractable safety syringes. Manual retractable safety syringes require healthcare professionals to manually retract the needle into the syringe barrel after use, reducing the risk of needlestick injuries. On the other hand, auto-retractable safety syringes automatically retract the needle into the syringe barrel once the injection is completed, providing an additional layer of protection for both patients and healthcare workers. Both types aim to prevent accidental needlestick injuries and promote safe healthcare practices.</p></p>
