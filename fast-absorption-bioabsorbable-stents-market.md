<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fast- absorption Bioabsorbable Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer-based Stents</li><li>Metallic Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fast-absorption bioabsorbable stents are a type of medical device used to treat blocked or narrowed arteries. They are designed to dissolve over time within the body, reducing the risk of long-term complications associated with traditional stents. Two main types of fast-absorption bioabsorbable stents are polymer-based stents and metallic stents. Polymer-based stents are made from biocompatible materials that gradually dissolve, while metallic stents are typically made from materials like magnesium that dissolve more rapidly. Both types offer the benefits of traditional stents without the long-term risks.</p></p>
