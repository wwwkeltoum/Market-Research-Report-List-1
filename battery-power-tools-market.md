<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Battery Power Tools Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brushed Motor</li><li>Brushless Motor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Battery power tools are classified into two main market types: brushed motor and brushless motor. In brushed motor tools, a series of carbon brushes come into contact with the commutator, creating friction and generating power. These tools are generally less expensive but have shorter lifespans and require more maintenance. On the other hand, brushless motor tools utilize electronic circuits instead of brushes, resulting in reduced friction and increased efficiency. Although they tend to be more expensive, brushless motor tools have longer lifetimes and require less maintenance.</p></p>
