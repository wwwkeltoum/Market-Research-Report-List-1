<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Brake Booster Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Brake</li><li>Disc Brake</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The hydraulic brake booster market comprises two main types: drum brake and disc brake. Drum brakes work by using brake shoes that press against the inside of a drum to stop the vehicle. They are less expensive but are less effective in dissipating heat. On the other hand, disc brakes use brake pads that squeeze against a rotor to halt the vehicle. They offer better heat dissipation and are more commonly used in modern vehicles. Both types of brakes play a crucial role in ensuring safe and reliable braking performance in vehicles.</p></p>
