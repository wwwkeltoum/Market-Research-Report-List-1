<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Structural Pervious Pavement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pervious Concrete</li><li>Porous Asphalt</li><li>Interlocking Concrete Pavers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Structural pervious pavement includes pervious concrete, porous asphalt, and interlocking concrete pavers. Pervious concrete is a mixture of cement, water, and coarse aggregates that allows water to pass through, reducing runoff and promoting infiltration. Porous asphalt consists of open-graded asphalt mixtures that allow water to drain through the pavement surface. Interlocking concrete pavers are solid concrete units with joints that allow water to infiltrate through the pavement. These types of structural pervious pavement help manage stormwater runoff and reduce the risk of flooding.</p></p>
