<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electron Beam Resists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Electron Beam Resists</li><li>Negative Electron Beam Resists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electron Beam Resists (EBR) refer to the materials used in the production of integrated circuits using electron beam lithography technology. Positive Electron Beam Resists are sensitive to the electron beam, causing a cross-linking reaction that increases the material's solubility. This enables the selective removal of the resist to create patterns. Conversely, Negative Electron Beam Resists darken under electron beam exposure, becoming insoluble. Thus, removal of the unexposed resist leaves behind patterns. Both types play crucial roles in microfabrication, with positive EBR suitable for high-resolution imaging and negative EBR ideal for large-area patterning.</p></p>
