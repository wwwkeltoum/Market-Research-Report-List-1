<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Retinal Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Epiretinal Implants</li><li>Subretinal Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Artificial retinal implants are advanced medical devices used to restore vision in individuals with retinal degenerative diseases. Epiretinal implants are placed on the surface of the retina, while subretinal implants are positioned beneath the retina. Epiretinal implants stimulate the remaining retinal cells to transmit visual signals to the brain, while subretinal implants directly stimulate the remaining retinal photoreceptor cells. These implants aim to bypass damaged cells and restore some level of vision by converting light into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain.</p></p>
