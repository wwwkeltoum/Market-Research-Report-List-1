<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three-Phase Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Core-Type Three-Phase Transformer(Single Core,Two Cores)</li><li>Shell-Type Three-Phase Transformer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Three-phase transformers are used to transfer electrical energy between three different voltage systems. The core-type three-phase transformers are available in two forms: single core and two cores. In single core transformers, all three windings are wound on a single magnetic core, while in two core transformers, each winding has its own separate magnetic core. Shell-type three-phase transformers have three separate magnetic circuits in a shell-like structure. These transformers are typically used in high-power applications due to their ability to handle large currents and voltages.</p></p>
