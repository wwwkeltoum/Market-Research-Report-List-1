<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rigid Isolator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Negative Pressure Isolator</li><li>Positive Pressure Isolator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Rigid isolators are used to provide a controlled environment for handling hazardous materials. Negative pressure isolators maintain a lower pressure inside compared to the surrounding environment, preventing the release of contaminants. They are commonly used in situations where protection from the materials inside is essential. Positive pressure isolators, on the other hand, maintain a higher pressure inside to prevent external contaminants from entering. These isolators are suitable for applications where aseptic conditions are required, such as in pharmaceutical manufacturing or sterile laboratories. Both types ensure safety and control in specific environments.</p></p>
