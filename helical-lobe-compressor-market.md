<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Helical-lobe Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-injected</li><li>Oil-free</li><li>Liquid Injection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The helical-lobe compressor market includes three types: oil-injected, oil-free, and liquid injection. Oil-injected compressors use oil to lubricate the compressor elements, reducing friction and extending the equipment's lifespan. Oil-free compressors, on the other hand, do not require lubricating oil, making them more suitable for applications where oil contamination is a concern. Liquid injection compressors inject liquid into the compression chamber to cool the air, improving energy efficiency and reducing the risk of overheating. Each type caters to specific requirements and industry demands.</p></p>
