<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Earthquake Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Motion Sensing Caged Ball</li><li>Excessive Flow Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Earthquake Valve Market consists of two types: Motion Sensing Caged Ball and Excessive Flow Sensor. Motion Sensing Caged Ball valves are designed to automatically shut off the gas supply during an earthquake, preventing the risk of gas leaks and potential explosions. They utilize a caged ball mechanism that moves with the motion of the earth, triggering the valve to close. On the other hand, Excessive Flow Sensor valves are equipped with sensors that detect abnormal gas flow due to a rupture or leak, immediately shutting off the gas supply to prevent accidents.</p></p>
