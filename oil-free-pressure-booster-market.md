<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil-free Pressure Booster Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oil-free pressure booster market includes two types: water cooled and air cooled. Water cooled pressure boosters use water as a cooling medium to maintain optimal working temperature and prevent overheating. They are typically used in industrial applications where large volumes of air need to be compressed. On the other hand, air-cooled pressure boosters rely on the surrounding air for cooling. They are more commonly found in smaller-scale applications, such as home compressors or small workshops. Both types offer efficient and oil-free pressurized air supply for different purposes.</p></p>
