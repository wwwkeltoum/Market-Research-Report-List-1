<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Modular Solar System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid-Tie Solar</li><li>Off-Grid Solar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The modular solar system market comprises two main types: grid-tie solar and off-grid solar. Grid-tie solar systems are connected to the electrical grid and allow users to generate their own solar energy while remaining connected to the utility company. This enables them to sell excess energy back to the grid. On the other hand, off-grid solar systems are not connected to the grid and rely solely on the generated solar power for electricity. They are commonly used in remote areas or as a backup power source.</p></p>
