<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inline Process Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage Pump</li><li>Multiple Stage Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The inline process pump market consists of two main types: single stage pump and multiple stage pump. A single stage pump has only one impeller that helps in moving the liquid from the inlet to the outlet. It is mainly used for low-pressure applications. On the other hand, a multiple stage pump consists of multiple impellers that are arranged in series. This type of pump is suitable for high-pressure applications where the liquid needs to be pumped over longer distances or against elevated heads.</p></p>
