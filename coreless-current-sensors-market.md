<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coreless Current Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coreless Closed Loop Current Sensor</li><li>Coreless Open Loop Current Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Coreless current sensors are devices used in electrical systems to measure the flow of electric current. There are two main types: coreless closed-loop current sensors and coreless open-loop current sensors. The coreless closed-loop current sensor measures current using a feedback mechanism, where the output is compared to the input to ensure accuracy. On the other hand, the coreless open-loop current sensor does not have a feedback mechanism and instead relies on the voltage produced by the current flowing through it. Both types have their specific applications and are essential for monitoring and controlling electric current.</p></p>
