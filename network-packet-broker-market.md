<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Network Packet Broker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inline Network Packet Broker</li><li>Non-inline Network Packet Broker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inline Network Packet Broker (NPB) is a type of network appliance that sits directly in the network path between network devices, allowing it to intelligently filter, redirect, and manipulate network traffic in real-time. It can efficiently distribute network packets to security and monitoring tools for analysis, without impacting network performance. Non-inline NPB, on the other hand, is deployed out of the network path, commonly using port mirroring or tapping techniques. It collects and forwards network packets to various tools for analysis, providing visibility into network traffic without disrupting network operations.</p></p>
