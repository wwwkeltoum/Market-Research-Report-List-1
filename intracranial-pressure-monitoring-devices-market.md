<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure Monitoring Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Monitoring Devices</li><li>Non-Invasive Monitoring Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intracranial pressure monitoring devices market consists of two types - invasive monitoring devices and non-invasive monitoring devices. Invasive monitoring devices are inserted directly into the brain to measure pressure, such as external ventricular drain, intraparenchymal monitors, and epidural sensors. These devices provide accurate and real-time measurements but carry risks of infection and other complications. Non-invasive monitoring devices, on the other hand, measure pressure indirectly without penetrating the brain, using techniques like transcranial Doppler ultrasound or fundoscopy. These devices are safer but may offer less precise measurements compared to invasive devices.</p></p>
